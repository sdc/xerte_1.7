<?php
////moodle integration (please view moodle_integration_readme.txt before use)
//the following line sets a session variable so that the separate config file doesn't restart session_start and kill the moodle session
//if demo.php or switch.php is used then this session isn't set so the installation works fine without moodle integration
$_SESSION['integrate_with_moodle'] = true;

//The require path below is the path to the moodle installation config file 
//usually found in the root of the moodle installation
//this needs to be the path from root rather than something like ../../moodle/config.php
//e.g. this might be something like require("/home/yourdomain/public_html/config.php");
//for a xampp/maxos install this should be something like require("/xampp/htdocs/moodle/config.php");
//set this same path in moodleintegration.php also
require("/xampp/htdocs/moodle/config.php");

//This ensures anyone visiting thie toolkits installation and this page direct is redirected to the moodle login first
//if not already logged in to moodle
