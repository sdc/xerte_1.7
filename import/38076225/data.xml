Research on different types of notes has also found that brevity and personal involvement greatly increase their effectiveness. (See table below)Unfortunately, materials such as course handouts, academic papers and magazine articles are written in traditional linear literary form, like short books, with few pointers to what is important. An honourable exception is the trade press, where boxes and other highlights are increasingly used in articles.Some students find it helpful to highlight key concepts on prints of the course materials or items downloaded during web research. The danger is that too much is highlighted and the connections are not clear. Your notes should aim to supplement the linear form by pulling together the main points and showing how they relate to each other (that is, providing emphasis and association).]]></textGraphics>		<tabNav linkID="PG1250675502640" name="Notes as pictures" text=" " panelWidth="Full" tabWidth="120">			<nestedPage name="Introduction" text="For any form of data, I find that being able to see it arranged graphically is very helpful, and would strongly commend the mind-mapping approach. It's also brilliant for taking notes at meetings – I've even projected notes while the meeting was taking place, so that everyone could see what they had said and its context!This method is illustrated in Figures 2 'Stages in the evolution of mind-map notes' and 3 'Adding relationships and comments', in which a simple ‘Mind Map’ is built on the topic of stencil printing variables. In the most complete version, some of the groupings and causal linkages have been drawn and appropriate notes have been added." align="Top" />			<nestedPage url="FileLocation + 'media/m0_h063_02.gif'" name="Figure 2: Stage 1" text=" " align="Top" />			<nestedPage url="FileLocation + 'media/m0_h063_03.gif'" name="Figure 2: Stage 2" text=" " align="Top" />			<nestedPage url="FileLocation + 'media/m0_h063_04.gif'" name="Figure 2: Stage 3" text=" " align="Top" />			<nestedPage url="FileLocation + 'media/m0_h063_05.gif'" name="Figure 3" text="Many people find it useful to use sketched visuals to supplement the Mind Map words, and different colours for emphasis.
